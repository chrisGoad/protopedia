===============

Tools for inspecting, editing, and saving things built in JavaScript.


This is a new project. As yet, there is no documentation of the server side of things, and that is probably a 
prerequisite to setting up your own installation. Coming soon! See
[http://prototypejungle.org](http://prototypejungle.org) and 
[http://prototypejungle.org/tech.html](http://prototypejungle.org/tech.html) for general information.
