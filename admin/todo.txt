I have had a black/white reaction to movies this summer, which is not my usual. Some seem to be the most intense nonsense, designed to somehow to steal your soul.   Others the opposite. Elysium was in the  former category  ( I looked forward to it based on "District 9"). So was Star Trek (no surprise), Pacific Rim (which I saw based on Pan's Labyrinth), and the truly horrible Lone Ranger. On the other side, Fruitvale Station, and Europa Report, both drenched in feel of the real, and exhilating for that reason.

a measure of change for the better: the idea that parents might involve themselves in their kids social struggles seems foreign to my
own experience growing up.

CHROME BUG  a very strange business bug in Chrome:
if you save, and then quickly repeatedly open tabs on the same inspect, no drawing will be visible (the canvas just isn't working). with delay
nothing goes wrong: it's something about canvas production rate or something. totally bizzarre, and doesn't happen on firefox

DONE do chart without need for mods (ie with own protos included) 
DONE still need tick proto
nodes that can't be expanded (like empty value nodes) should not have expandos

DONE deep copy obsolete
DONE figure out cleann setup for the libraries (geom,lightbox etc)
DONE rip out inspectable stuff, replaced by computed?

DONE take a picture button
DONE don't include prototypes outside of the workspace, and show values instead of "inherited" at the frontier
DONE clean up names for get, getval set, setval. Should probabluy be only om.get om.set
DONE scroll into view is not quite right
DONE in bezier,  don't set the arc's props in update
DONE hide the hit canvas
DONE (lack of linewidth for arc) why is selection faint before an expand?

DONE bring back prototypes that are "below the fold", ie not in ws, not editable
DONE lib.DNode.iterInheritedItems = function (fn,otherProps) { don't need otherprops anymore, I don't think
PUNT OR NEVER contract needs work for chart.
DONE clean up refs to modules (lib vs om eg in externalize)

PUNT cause datasource loading to run in parallel, like grab, rather than sequentially

DONE indicate which lines have notes


DONE regular page for missing build files

implement and document lift
add the name() method to dnode,lnode

STAGE 2 get rid of installType
STAGE 2 beautiful, uniform indentation
STAGE 2       host = "prototypejungle.org"; // todo generalize this for other servers

Stage 2 look into completely hiding properties as in startAngle of cirles
STAGE 3 inputF outputF are special cases of function references.generalize? functions would need parent pointers.
STAGE 2 when creating images, compute size of the pic
STAGE 2 a nit: if you modify an item, and then save its image, it writes the modified fellow at the main path of the fellow.  There
  should be a warning.

in build, warn if not a js file
DONE watch out for tree.adjust while typing new vals into the tree itself; should be prohibited
tech doc needs a pass
DONE why does the tree open when anything is moved?

R1 get login situation together. Don't show "logout" unless you are really logged in, eg (need an api call to check). Also,
 remember the page a user was at when a log in happens.
 R1 lengthen auto session end to days 
R1 in textbox; html escape incoming data
R1 om.changeReporter in om2 for (j in fns) goes thru all the DNode fns. 
R1 check session issue. See eg http://prototypejungle.org:8000/buildd?item=/foo/repo0/chart/LineChart
R1 build page no longer delivering error message on js error (seems to be when the update fails)
R1 text should not be frozen for axis
R1 height should be frozen for all text
R1 clear out things like __dataTransform__ before saving.
R1 don't forget to remove __data__ before saving
R1 up in the selected item browser should update prototypes too
R1 hidden properties not needed in ovr for  show properties
R1 better messages on data load failure; look in grabData also unifiy grabData, loadData
R1 stash restore data need to recurse
R1 turn off debugMode in om1
R1 bundled fellows
R1 pop message if missing data
R1 rename the map operator throughout
R1 highlighted linewidth should 2* linewidth
R1 functions from components are getting included in the code files of the container. See:http://s3.prototypejungle.org/sys/repo0/chart/Bubble1/code.js
R1 setError in page.js should be genError or something; to test eg http://prototypejungle.org:8000/buildd?item=http://s3.prototypejungle.org/sys/repo0/chart/Bubble1

R1 dataSource should be read only in the inspector; overridden by getarg
R1 make sure other domains can't send post messsages
DONE  put see tree in the obdiv
R1 make sure error handling works in view;missing item
R1 See pix two arcs. When expanding the no toggle version, need to fully expand down to arrays
R1 if  "http://s3.prototypejungle.org/sys/repo0/chart/CaptionedCircle", is included in the rebuild
   of LineChart, then an infinite loop arises in  om.installParentLinks1
DONE insert is horked

R1 consider:
var pj = prototypeJungle;
var om = pj.om;
var svg = pj.svg;
//item.set("c",svg.shape.mk('<circle transform="translate(200 100)" \
//               style="fill:red" r="100" cx="20" cy="200"/>'));
var bubbleP = pj.chart.component.Bubble.instantiate().hide();
item.set("b1",bubbleP.instantiate()).show();


Then bubbleP has not been "set" into the tree; the prototype chain from b1 exits the tree.
Now there is no coherent warning; the resulting save fails to load, is all.

DONE R1 when inherting colors for chooser, need to take proto panels into account; search for @todo should apply this to the proto chain too
DONE R1 data topbar should go to data editor when data is at s3
R2  improved  error handling on bad install search for __installFailure__ in inspect.js; genMainPage should report
    the exact error
R1 many variables need "var"ing in inspect.js; check window

DONE R1 in share, compute aspect ratio for the embed

DONE R1 do the computed from data thing
R2 improved error handling part 2: suppose have code with a.b = c.instantiate, and c is not in the tree
  then things go wrong in internalizing this when externalized. Need a diagnostic that looks at a tree
  before saving to see if everything needed is there
R2 Error handling for bad html in dom parsing

DONE select string-valued fellow, prototype chain wrong
use deleteObjects in node/s3.js
DONE delete item should be some where accessible when chooser from eg tech.html rather than inspect

new user login off
pop help, about
visit the charts via the chooser check them out
do example build from tech doc
