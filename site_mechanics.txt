The main sites: prototypejungle.org and openchart.net reside at S3. There is also a live ec2 server, running node,
which serves two purposes:  storage serving,and tranfering code from the source tree up to s3.

The source tree is c:\prototypejungle.  It has parts that are distributed here and there.
Its www subtree goes up to prototypejungle.org, on S3.
Its openchart/www subtree goes  up to openchart.net, on openchart.net (also at S3).
Its openchart/repo1 subtree goes up to openchart.net/sys/repo1
Its storage_server tree goes to  prototype-jungle.org/home/ubuntu/storage_server, and
  prototype-jungle/home/ubuntu/storage_server_dev.

prototype-jungle.org/home/ubuntu/storage_server_dev is kept up-to-date directly by using winscp to sync it  to
c:\prototypejungle.org\storage_server

The other routes are slightly more complicated. The principle is to maintain transfer directories at prototype-jungle.org
Winscp is used to get files from the source tree up to the transfer directories.
Then three scripts in prototype-jungle/home/ubuntu/storage_server_dev/admin complete the transfer up to S3. admin/assemble.js
takes care of JavaScript code (it also assembles files together into modules, and minifies). admin/updateS3.js takes care of the
other kinds of files (html, svg, css, etc). admin/toRepo1.js 

The transfer station for prototypejungle.org is at prototype-jungle.org/home/ubuntu/xfer_prototypejungle,
  which mirrors (winscp wise) c:\prototypejungle\www
The transfer station for openchart.net is at prototype-jungle.org/home/ubuntu/xfer_openchart,
    which mirrors (winscp wise) c:\prototypejungle\openchart\www
The transfer station for openchart.net/sys/repo1 is at prototype-jungle.org/home/ubuntu/xfer_repo1,
    which mirrors (winscp wise) c:\prototypejungle\openchart\repo1


These are used for development  files. For production, there is prototype-jungle.org/home/ubuntu/git,
which mirrors the entire prototypejungle repository at git hub.  The assemble and updateS3 scripts, when working in production
mode, transfer from the git directory.
