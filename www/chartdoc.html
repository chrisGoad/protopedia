<div id="leftColumn" style="position:absolute;">


<p>Try left-clicking  one of the bars of the graph. On the right-hand side of
the screen, you will see two panels, labeled "Workspace" and "Prototype Chain". The workspace panel displays
the structure of the javascript objects which represent the chart, in hierarchical form. Because you have clicked a bar on the chart,
the workspace inpector highlights the particular object, of type Rectangle, representing the bar.  If you open this object by clicking the &#x25BA; next to it, you will observe its internal
structure. Open up the child named "stylee". Note that if you enter "red" as the "fillstyle", the bar in question
will turn red.</p>
</div>
<div id="rightColumn" style="position:absolute;">

<p>The panel labeled "Prototype Chain" displays the chain for the selected object, in this case a rectangle. (For an explanation
of prototype chains, see
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain" target="_blank">this</a>
document.) The first element of this chain, displayed at the top of the panel, also has a "fillstyle" property.  If you enter "green" as the
new value of this property, you will observe that all of the bars in the chart turn green. That is because each of the JavaScript rectangle
objects for those bars inherits from this same prototype. If you click on the line reading "chart.Chart.marks.template", all shapes on the chart
which inherit from this prototype are highlighted: that is, all of the bars. Generally, if you click on something in the workspace or prototype panels,
the corresponding graphical objects will be highlighted, and vice-versa.</p>

<p> Now try clicking on various parts of the chart, for example, the numerical captions, the "ticks", the axes. This will allow you to observe
the prototype structure underlying each of these items. </p>
