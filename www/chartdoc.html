<p><span style="color:red">Instructions:</span>  Left-click one of the bars of the graph. 
As a consequence, the properties of the selected item are displayed in the middle panel/object tab. If you select a new color for the "fillStyle" of the selected item, the bar in question
will turn that color. <p>The panel labeled "Prototype Chain" displays the chain for the selected object, that is, the series of objects from which it
<span style='color:blue;cursor:pointer;text-decoration:underline' onClick='parent.location.href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain"'>inherits</span>.
The first element of this chain, in this case, also has a "fillStyle" property.  If you pick a new color  for this, all of other bars in the chart turn that shade. That is because each of the JavaScript rectangle
objects for those bars inherits from this same prototype.  </p>

<div id="rightColumn" style="position:absolute;">


 
 <p>Try clicking on some other things, such as the captions or ticks.</p>
<p>
The Up and Down buttons above the graphics can be used to move up and down the containment hierarchy.
For example, if you
click on a label of the axis, then Up, the properties of the axis as a whole will be displayed</p>
<p> If you are logged in, you can make changes in any item, and then save the modified version as your own.</p>
<!--
    
<p>The panel labeled "Prototype Chain" displays the chain for the selected object, in this case a rectangle. The first element of this chain, displayed at the top of the panel, also has a "fillstyle" property.  If you enter "green" as the
new value of this property, you will observe that all of the bars in the chart turn green. That is because each of the JavaScript rectangle
objects for those bars inherits from this same prototype. If you click on the line reading "chart.Chart.marks.template", all shapes on the chart
which inherit from this prototype are highlighted: that is, all of the bars. Generally, if you click on something in the workspace or prototype panels,
the corresponding graphical objects will be highlighted, and vice-versa. The same approach will serve to modify other aspects of the chart, such as ticks or captions, either individually, or collectively.</p>
