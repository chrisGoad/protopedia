<p>Try left-clicking  one of the bars of the graph. Note that the
the workspace inpector highlights the particular Javascript object, of type Rectangle, representing the bar that you have clicked.  If you open this object by clicking the &#x25BA; next to it, you will observe its internal
structure. Open up the child named "style". Note that if you enter "red" as the "fillStyle", the bar in question
will turn red.</p>
</div>
<div id="rightColumn" style="position:absolute;">

<p>The panel labeled "Prototype Chain" displays the chain for the selected object, in this case a rectangle. The first element of this chain also has a "fillStyle" property.  If you enter "green" as the
new value of this property, all of other bars in the chart turn green. That is because each of the JavaScript rectangle
objects for those bars inherits from this same prototype.  
<i> Now try clicking on some other things, such as the captions or ticks.</i></p>

<p>The panel labeled "Prototype Chain" displays the chain for the selected object, in this case a rectangle. The first element of this chain, displayed at the top of the panel, also has a "fillstyle" property.  If you enter "green" as the
new value of this property, you will observe that all of the bars in the chart turn green. That is because each of the JavaScript rectangle
objects for those bars inherits from this same prototype. If you click on the line reading "chart.Chart.marks.template", all shapes on the chart
which inherit from this prototype are highlighted: that is, all of the bars. Generally, if you click on something in the workspace or prototype panels,
the corresponding graphical objects will be highlighted, and vice-versa.</p>

<p> Now try clicking on various parts of the chart, for example, the numerical captions, the "ticks", the axes. This will allow you to observe
the prototype structure underlying each of these items. </p>
