<div> The current implementation serves primarily as a proof of concept.
 Nonetheless, the core functionality, including the development environment needed to create new items, is available if not polished. Here are further notes
 about the stage of development.</p>
 
 , and was used for these initial examples.
<div>There are two documents:</div>
<div style="padding:20px">A short <a href="/userguide.html">user guide</a>, for those who wish to customize and bind data to existing PrototypeJungle items (such as charts). Little or no
programming is required, though a few operations are explained that can be used by progammers  for such things as doing periodic updates from live data feeds.
Given the early stage of PrototypeJungle development, there is only one kind of chart so far to which this applies, but one example is all that is required to illustrate the techniques.</p>
</div>
<div style="padding:20px"><a href="/tech.html">The technical documentation</a>, which explains the technology in detail and describes how JavaScript programmers can implement their own items.</div>
