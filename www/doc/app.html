<div class="pageTitle"> Potential Application: Open Drawing and Charting</div>

<p> An open drawing and charting application, in which visual elements and chart types could be
contributed by any JavaScript developer anywhere, is a possible application of the PrototypeJungle technology.</p>

<p> The technology has three aspects which recommend it for this purpose:</p>

<p>1) The scheme of representation allows for a  user interface 
 in which all elements and prototypes are adjustable, and this UI is uniform across shapes and chart types.
 <!--Uniformity of programmatic access is present as well. This brings powers
 of adjustment beyond those normally found in charting applications. PrototypeJungle is a good fit for charting 
because 
 prototype trees nicely capture the inner structure of  charts, which are built largely by binding data to instantiated prototypes to yield marks.
 -->
 </p>

<p>2) Components of all sorts, including shapes, chart types, and data transformation methods,
can be contributed by any JavaScript programmer anywhere, since components can be loaded from any URL.</p>

<p>3) <a href="/doc/code.html#controllers">Controllers</a>, consisting of draggable handles, with custom behavior,  can be built into  any component.</p>

<p>Much of the infrastructure needed to carry out this plan is already available. In particular, each of the features
mentioned just above is already present  in the current implementaion. One capability that needs adding
is of a routine sort: extension of the UI with capabilities like insertion and deletion of shapes and charts, and selection of data sources, giving full support
to end-users performing charting/drawing work.
Another is less routine: a scheme for maintaining component
libraries with open access and contribution.</p>

<p style="padding-bottom:20px">Of course, the designerly aspects of the UI will need work too.  And finally,
the project will only make the transition into practical utility for charting and drawing with
a sufficiently large component library.</p>
