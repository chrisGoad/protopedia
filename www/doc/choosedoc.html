 <p>PrototypeJungle is a proof of concept, and at this early stage is more likely to be of interest for its technical approach than as a production system for infographics.   The current library of infographic components
 is tiny, and the UI is a proof-of-concept. Nonetheless, I wished to illustrate how the system would be used
 in a production context. Accordingly, two short usage guides  are included, in addition to the technical description.
 (The guides describe the current working system).
