<p>PrototypeJungle is new, and serves primarily as a proof of concept.  
Only a few infographic types have been implemented so far. The tools for adding new types are available for any developer who
wishes to give them a try, albeit in a development environment that is also a proof of concept.
</p><p>
Given the early stage of development, it is the core technology, described in 1),
that is  most likely to be of interest. The guides 2) and 3)  are included
in order to illustrate a possible mode of application, rather than in the expectation of immediate
production  use (although the guides do describe the working system).
The guides are short stand-alone documents.</p>
 </p>

 <p>At this early stage, PrototypeJungle is more likely to be of interest for its technical approach, and as a
 developoment tool, than as a production system for infographics.   The current library of infographic components
 is tiny, and the UI is a proof-of-concept. Nonetheless, I wished to illustrate how the system would be used
 in a production context. Accordingly, two short usage guides  are included, in addition to the technical description.
 (The guides do describe the current working system).
<!--I don't anticipate production use at this stage. Nonetheless, the basic scheme is in place.-->
