<!--<p>  PrototypeJungle is new.  At this stage, the implementation serves  primarily as a proof of concept
for the basic idea: exposing the prototype structure of infographics. This has been carried
out for only a few examples so far. Nonetheless, the core functionality, including the development environment needed
to create new items, is available if not polished, and was used for these initial examples.
</p>-->

<p> PrototypeJungle is new, and serves primarily as a proof of concept. Only two illustrative  infographic types have been implemented
so far.</p>
<p>
It will require programming effort to make other infographic
types available in PrototypeJungle's transparent form, although the tools for doing this are ready, if not polished.
(Basic building blocks, such as axes and legends, are reusable). 

Once this has been done for a given type, non-programmers will be free to use the new type -
to supply their own data, 
and to take advantage of transparency and adjustability. So if you are a developer, and wish to experiment with
building new items in PrototypeJungle, please proceed!<!--For example, right now, if someone wished to take the bubble/time chart of the
sort used for the weather events example on the home page, and supply her own data (eg air crashes) and adjustments, she could do so
without programming.--></p>

<p>PrototypeJungle has been an individual effort so far. Now that it is released in preliminary form, there are two alternative ways
to put it to use.  One is implementation of a suite of the basic
chart types (line, pie, bar, scatter, column and so forth). Another is development of more specialized but more interesting infographics
for individual applications. In the latter case, even if there is only a single target infograph, the adjustability will mean that
work can be split between programmer and designer in a new way. Please contact me if there's an infograph that you would like to see
developed in this style, or if you have an interest in collaborating on the basic suite.</p>

<p>The development environment
 customize them to your own needs, and bind data to them.  </p>
<p>To save items that you
have customized in the inspector you need to sign in.
No registration is needed; you can sign in with your email or twitter account.
When you first sign in at PrototypeJungle, you choose a handle, and thereafter, all of your content will be stored under</p>
<pre>
http://prototypejungle.org/<i>yourHandle</i>
</pre>

 <p>Within this
filespace your content is organized into <i>repos</i>, of which you may allocate as many as you like.</p>
 
<p>First, load the item of interest into the inspector.  PrototypeJungle is new, so at the moment there are very few options. See the disclaimer
about the stage of development. </p>

<p>Then adjust prototypes and instances in the item as explained at the bottom of X. In the <i>file</i> pulldown there are two
options for saving: "Save as build" and "Save as variant".  The former is for programmers who wish to create a copy of the item for their
own development.  To save adjustments, use "Save as variant".    By default, a particular spot at prototypejungle will be offered -
something like:

<pre>
http://prototypejungle.org/sys/repo0dev/example/variants/BarChart2/v1
</pre>

<p>
But you may choose any location beneath yourHandle that you like.
</p>

<p>At the time that you save a variant, a new data source may also be chosen.  The format for data is described here.  A data source may be placed
at any URL. </p>

<p> Any item can be embedded into web pages, or viewed at its own URL. Click the share button for options. Items can also be loaded and bound
to new data with Javascript, enabling such things as programattic updating of data from a real-time source.</p>


<div class="section" id="custom">1. Loading items with JavaScript </div>

<p>Items can be loaded into a web page with code such as this: </p>

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt; 
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://s3.prototypejungle.org/min/draw.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;

// load a bar chart,and bind data
$('document').ready(function () {
   var draw = prototypeJungle.draw;
   var itemUri = "http://s3.prototypejungle.org/sys/repo0/chart/variants/BarChart/v4";
   var cnv = draw.initCanvas($('#canvas'));
   cnv.bkColor = "white";
   cnv.fitFactor = 0.7;
   draw.installAsRoot(itemUri,cnv,function (rs) {
     rs.setData({value:[{x:1,y:26},{x:2,y:12},{x:3,y:40},{x:4,y:14}]});
     rs.update();
     cnv.fitContents();
     cnv.refresh();
   });
});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;div&gt; Example: barchart &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="canvas" style="width:800px;height:500px;border:solid thin black"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>

<p>The itemUri should be the URI of the variant that you saved off, which you can discover from the share button.</p>

<div class="section" id="loadData">1. Loading data </div>

<p>As seen from the above example, setData does the binding of data to an item.  The following code fragment loads and binds data
programmatically:  </p>

<pre>
prototypeJungle.om.loadData("http://s3.prototypejungle.org/sys/repo0/data/bardata0.json",function  (e,d) {
  if (e) {
      ... handle error eg alert(e.message); ...
  } else {
      item.setData(d);
  }
}
</pre>
<p> For each kind of item you can see by example what sort of data it expects from the data button in the top bar. Of course,
using this primitive, you 
could programmatically load and display data at intervals from a changing data source.</p>
