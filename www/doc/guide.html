<div class="pageTitle">User Guide: customizing and binding data</div>

<p><!--
<i style="font-size:10pt">PrototypeJungle has only a few illustrative chart types in its library so far.
I don't anticipate production use at this stage. Nonetheless, the basic scheme is in place.</i> </p>-->
<!--<p>This document explains how to 
 customize and bind new data to PrototypeJungle items, in a manner
that does not involve  programming.  </p>-->
<p>To save items that you
have customized in the inspector you need to sign in.
No registration is needed; you can sign in with your email or twitter account.
When you first sign in at PrototypeJungle, you choose a handle, and thereafter, all of your content will be stored under</p>
<pre>
http://prototypejungle.org/<i>yourHandle</i>
</pre>

 <p>Within this
filespace your content is organized into <i>repos</i>, of which you may allocate as many as you like.</p>
 
<p>First, load the item of interest into the inspector.  Here is an example you can try (others can be found from the
file pulldown):
</p>
<div>
 
<div>
  <div style="display:inline-block">
    <div id="Bar1" class="guideChart"><a href="/inspect?item=/sys/repo0/chart/Bar1">Bar Chart</a></div>
    <iframe frameborder="0" width="600" height="400" style="overflow:hidden"
        src="http://prototypejungle.org.s3.amazonaws.com/sys/repo0/chart/Bar1/svg.html"></iframe>

  </div>
  
</div>



<p>
Then adjust to taste as explained at the bottom of
<a href="/inspect?item=/sys/repo0/example/BarChart2&intro=1">the introductory example</a>. Note that all parts
of an item are adjustable.  For example, if you want to adjust something about the legend, click on it, and then
on "up" to navigate to the legend as a whole from the part of it that you clicked, and
then adjust parameters in the "selected item" panel. </p>
<p> You can adjust the colors associated with
categories by modifying those associated with the legend
(click on the little squares within the legend, and adjust in the object browser). These
changes will be automatically propagated to
the corresponding bars. You can also drag the legend to whereever you want it.</p>
<p> To save your work:
In the <i>file</i> pulldown 
choose "Save as variant" to save your adjusted chart with its new data source.  By default, a particular spot at prototypejungle will be offered -
something like:</p>

<pre>
    FIX THIS
http://prototypejungle.org/myHandle/repo0/example/variants/BarChart2/v1
</pre>

<p>
But you may choose any location beneath myHandle that you like.
</p>

<p> Any item can be embedded into web pages, or viewed at its own URL. Click the share button when inspecting the variant for options. Items can also be loaded and bound
to new data with Javascript, enabling such things as programatic updating of data from a real-time source.  See this
<a href="/doc/embed.html">document</a>.</p>
