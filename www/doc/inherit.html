<p> Most programmers will be familiar with the notion of inheritance, but the meaning and utility of the term
is general,
and not tied to programming specifically. Here is an explanation which does not draw programming into the account.</p>


<p> Of course, in ordinary language, X inherits from Y means that property owned by Y is passed to  X when Y dies.
In this context, what is meant is  different, and no one needs to die. Namely, if X inherits from Y in our sense, it means that whenever
Y has a property, such as a color, X will "inherit" that same color, unless explicitly stated otherwise.  <!--For example, we have a prototype of the
notion of a swan in our head, which tells us the color of any individual swan anyone mentions without them needing to say anything (at least
for most peoople until Nasin Talib)-->
So in describing X, we don't have to repeat all the information about X that it inherits from Y.</p>
  <!--(think of the effort we save in
describing a scarab if we first let on that it is a beetle) This pattern appears frequently in ordinary life, for example, whenever X is a kind of Y (conifers and
trees, or Cars and Vehicles for example).--><p>X might inherit from Y and Y in turn from Z.  This is what is called a "prototype chain".</p>

<p>In our canonical example
of the bar graph, each bar inherits from the bar prototype. You can see this in the interface. Click on a bar and you will notice 

<p>Specifically 
<p>The structure that gets instantiated is 
 a   property/value tree  whose nodes are sometimes already connected by
prototype chains. Functions may appear in the tree, but only as leaves. Loosely but concisely, I refer to this  structure as
a "prototype tree".
  </p>

<p>The instantiation  operation takes the tree, and peels off a copy, but only copies interior nodes. Instead of copying atomic data,
it anchors  the prototype chains of the new nodes back in the counterpart node in the old tree. 

<p>Prototype trees have an external representation, and serve as the basis for libraries of infographic components. </p>
<p>Full details on Prototype Trees and the instatiation operator appear in the technical documentation.</p>
