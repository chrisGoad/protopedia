<div class="pageTitle">Prototypes and Inheritance</div>

<p> JavaScript programmers are familiar with  prototypical inheritance, but the meaning and utility of the concept
is general  and fairly simple, and a programming-free explanation is possible.</p>


<p> When we say that A is a prototype for B,  we mean that whenever
A has a property, such as a color, B will "inherit" that same color, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
So in describing B, we don't have to repeat all the information about B that it inherits from A. Think of the effort we save in
describing a scarab if we first let on that it is a kind of beetle. <!--This pattern appears frequently in ordinary life, for example, whenever X is a kind of Y (conifers and
trees, or Cars and Vehicles for example).--><p>C might inherit from B and B in turn from A.  This is what is called a "prototype chain".
</p>

<p>In our canonical example,
the <a href = "http://prototypejungle.org/ui?intro=1&source=http://prototypejungle.org/sys/repo3|example/bar_chart.js">bar chart</a>, each bar in the chart inherits from a common prototype. You can see this in the interface.
Click on a bar and you will see its chain.</p>

programmers.</p>
