<div class="pageTitle">Prototypes and Inheritance</div>


<p> JavaScript programmers are familiar with  prototypical inheritance, but the meaning and utility of the concept
is general  and fairly simple. Here is a programming-free explanation.</p>


<p> When we say that Y is a prototype for X,  we mean that whenever
Y has a property, such as a color, X will "inherit" that same color, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
So in describing X, we don't have to repeat all the information about X that it inherits from Y.</p>
  <!--(think of the effort we save in
describing a scarab if we first let on that it is a beetle) This pattern appears frequently in ordinary life, for example, whenever X is a kind of Y (conifers and
trees, or Cars and Vehicles for example).--><p>X might inherit from Y and Y in turn from Z.  This is what is called a "prototype chain".
</p>

<p>In our canonical example,
the <a href = "/inspect.html?item=/sys/repo0/example/BarChart2&intro=1">bar chart</a>, each bar in the chart inherits from a common prototype. You can see this in the interface. Click on a bar and you will see its chain.</p>

programmers.</p>
