Every element of the chart is adjustable with a click. Many are draggable and resizable, for example,
the labels "Gold", "Silver", etc. </div>
<div style="padding-top:10px;margin:0px"> 
The Up and Down buttons that appear above the graphics can be used to move up and down the containment hierarchy.
For example, after clicking "Gold", if you click "Up" a few times, a resizer for the entire chart will appear.  Try rezising
the chart.</div>

The right-hand panel displays properties of the selected object, and its prototype if any. Here's
an explanation of the role of prototypes.</div>-->
<div style="padding-top:10px;margin:0px"> <span style="color:red">Prototypes</span>
Many of the elements of the chart are derived from an adjustable
<span style="color:blue" onclick="parent.location.href='/doc/inherit.html'">prototype</span>. <!-- In these cases,
each individual (eg an individual bar) derives some properties from the prototype, and some are particular to the
individual.
In the case of bars, the height, width, and position are computed for each bar by the chart-generator, but the fill color,
stroke color, and stroke width are derived from the common prototype of the bars (barP). 
When the selected object is derived from a prototype-->
The right-hand panel displays properties of the selected object, and its prototype if adjustable. 
</div> 
<div style="padding-top:10px;margin:0px">
For example, if you click on a bar, you can adjust the fill color of its prototype, and all of the bars will turn
that color (try it). Similarly, if you resize one of the labels, it is the prototype that gets resized, and so you
will see each label derived from this prototype change scale.</div> 
<div  style="padding-top:10px;margin:0px">All subparts of the chart, such as the axes, and including the whole chart, are derived from prototype trees.
