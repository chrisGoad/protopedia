<p><b>Prototypes and Instances</b></p>
  <p>In case you're curious: this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_graph" target="_top">Cayley diagram</a> of the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group" target="_top">dihedral group</a> D3 - the symmetries of an isolateral triangle. </p>
  
<p>Try clicking on one of the circles.
As a consequence, its own properties and those of its prototype  are displayed in two boxes in the right-hand panel.
All of the circles are derived from the same prototype. Prototypes are a core feature of JavaScript, but you don't need to be
a programmer to understand them, nor to use PrototypeJungle.
Here is a <a href="/doc/inherit.html" target="_top">programming-free explanation.</a></p>

<p>Having selected a circle,  if you edit the fill property of the
prototype, all circles change color, whereas editing the fill of the "selected item" affects only the circle you selected.
Note that a resizer appears around the circle. You can modify the circle size with a drag on the resizer. By default, the
prototype is resized, but you can also resize the individual circle, by checking the "Adjusting this" check box at the top of the "Selected item"
panel. Note that the circles are draggable too, and drag along the edges pointing to them. This functionality is not built into PrototypeJungle
but is a feature implemented by the graph component (a catalog item). New catalog items can have their own UI behaviors.</p>

<p> The arrows and labels are also derived from a common prototype. Try selecting an arrow and adjusting it.</p>


<p>The Up and Down buttons that appear above the graphics can be used to move up and down the containment hierarchy.
For example, after clicking a circle or arrow, if you click "Up", properties of the containing vertex or edge list will
appear. In this case, no edits are available at the containing level.
