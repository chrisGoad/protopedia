diagrams are like, and
serves as a diagram in the PrototypeJungle documentation).</p>-->
<p>
  <b>Inserting and cloning.</b></p>
<p><b>Inserting</b>.If you click "insert" on the top bar, a catalog of visual elements available for insert appears. Most are resizable: click on the catalog
entry of interest, then drag out a box for inserting that element with the desired dimensions. You can tell if an insertee is resizable by
the kind of cursor that appears over the graphics window: cross-hair for resizing, plus symbol for addition at a point without resizing.</p>
<p>Try inserting a few circles.</p>
<p>A <span style="color:red">clone</span> of an element is one which shares its prototype. For example, if you clone a circle several times,
the original and all of the clones will inherit from the same prototype, and can be edited (eg resized or re-colored) together. </p>

<p><b>Cloning</b> If you select (click on) an
element, the clone button on the top bar will be enabled - in nearly every case (a few elements are not cloneable). After clicking "clone",
you can add a series of clones of the selected element with clicks and usually drags. As in insertion, most elements can be sized with
a drag, but some cannot - the cursor indicates which situation pertains.</p>

<p>Try cloning and then adjusting one of the circles.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Each insert has its own prototype.</p>
