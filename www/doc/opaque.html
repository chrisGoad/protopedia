<p>
    
    
    <p>A program is an opaque object except (maybe) to a programmer.
    However, there are families of computation  whose underlying structure 
    can be exposed via UI to  non-programmers.
    The effort of formulating and exposing this kind of structure  sometimes brings large rewards.
     The cannonical example: consider a piece of code
    that performs a financial computation compared to a spreadsheet  with the same purpose.  Exactly the same computational steps might be
    involved in a calculation, but by exposing the structure outwardly, powers are given to everyone.</p>
   
    <p>Prototype chains constitute a general structure that underlies all JavaScript computations.
    So far, they  have  been hidden in code.
    But chains might make sense to many non-programmers, if they could see them.
    After all, the idea that some things are specialized variants of others (firs are connifers are trees) is part of
    general cognition, not programming expertise. </p><p>  A major purpose of PrototypeJungle is to run this experiment.  </p>
