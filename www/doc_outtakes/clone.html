<p>  A  fundamental operation in JavaScript is cloni of a prototype via new f(), which clones
f.prototype, or Object.create(x), which clones x itself. These operations create one new object and one new link of
 prototype chain.</p>
<p>PrototypeJungle lifts prototypical cloning in such a way that it applies at one blow to components of arbitrary complexity.
<!--
PrototypeJungle defines a notion of component  together  with an instantiation operation which 
maps  prototypical instantiation across the structure of the component to which it is applied. -->In the application area, this mode of cloning  works with infographic components
such as bubbles, bars, axes, legends, and, indeed, whole charts.  What are called "marks" in infographics are implemented as
clones
of a common prototype, modified as appropriate for the data points which they represent.  Here are some details:</p>



<p>The form of a component is 
 a   property/value tree  whose nodes are sometimes already connected by
prototype chains. Functions may appear in the tree, but only as leaves. Loosely but concisely, I refer to this  structure as
a "prototype tree".
  </p>

<p>The cloning  operation takes the tree, and makes a deep copy, but only copies interior nodes. The copying step  reproduces
the prototype chain structure of the original, too, not just its tree structure. It does not copy atomic (numeric/string/function)
properties. Instead 
it anchors  the prototype chains of the new nodes back to the counterpart node in the old tree, so that the atomic properties come along
by inheritance. <!-- This may sound a bit complicated, but a year's experience indicates that it "does the right thing".--></p>


<p>Prototype trees have an external representation, completing the requirements for a component system. </P>

<p>Full details on Prototype Trees and the clone operator appear in the technical documentation.</p>
