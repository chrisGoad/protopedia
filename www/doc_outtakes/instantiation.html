<div class="pageTitle">Prototypical Instantiation of Trees</div>


<p>  A  (the?) fundamental operation in JavaScript is instantiation of a prototype via new f(), which instantiates
f.prototype, or Object.create(x), which instantiates x itself. These operations create one new object and one new link of
 prototype chain.</p>  <p>PrototypeJungle provides the means for applying  this sort of operation at one blow  to something more  
more complex than a single object. In the application area, this mode of instantiation  works with infographic components
such as bubbles, bars, axes, legends, and, indeed, whole charts.  What are called "marks" in infographics are implemented as
instantiations
of a common prototype, modified as appropriate for the data points which they represent.  Here are some details:</p>



<p>The structure that gets instantiated is 
 a   property/value tree  whose nodes are sometimes already connected by
prototype chains. Functions may appear in the tree, but only as leaves. Loosely but concisely, I refer to this  structure as
a "prototype tree".
  </p>

<p>The instantiation  operation takes the tree, and peels off a copy, but only copies interior nodes. Instead of copying atomic data,
it anchors  the prototype chains of the new nodes back in the counterpart node in the old tree. 

<p>Prototype trees have an external representation, so can serve as the basis for libraries of infographic components. </p>
<p>Full details on Prototype Trees and the instatiation operator appear in the technical documentation.</p>
