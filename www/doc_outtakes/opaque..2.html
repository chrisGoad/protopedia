<p>Prototype chains constitute a general structure that underlies all JavaScript computations.
    So far, they  have  been hidden in code.
    But chains might make sense to many non-programmers, if they could see them.
    After all, the idea that some things are specialized variants of others (firs are connifers are trees) is part of
    general cognition, not programming expertise. And once visible, they can be manipulated too, giving new powers to non-programmers.</p>
 
    <p>  A major purpose of PrototypeJungle is to run this experiment.  
    More is required than
    the intention  to expose chains, if they are embedded in an otherwise tangled structure. It turns out, however, that
    <a href="/doc/tech.html#prototypeTrees">prototype trees</a>,
    that is, tree data structures with added information which connects nodes along prototype chains, are adequate  in functionality,
    and sufficiently constrained to be presented effectively in a UI. They can be saved as
    components too.
   </p>
     
    <p> There have been other cases of exposing the structure underlying  related sets of computations via a UI.
     The cannonical example: consider a piece of code
    that performs a financial computation compared to a spreadsheet  with the same purpose.  Exactly the same computational steps might be
    involved in a calculation, but by exposing the structure outwardly, powers are given to everyone.</p>
    
     <p>
   Another example, recently in <a href="http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/10/transformative-programming.html">vogue</a>,
    though with a long history:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming">Flow-based programming</a> arises from the observation
   that many kinds of computation can be formulated as flows of messages between  active nodes of  a graph, and 
 from  the utility of making the graph visible. </p>
     
     <p>These cases illustrate that  the effort of bringing structure out of the opaquenness of code can bring large rewards.</p>
