<p style="color:red"><i>Prototype Jungle is down for a very brief maintainence, but the static documents are available. </i></p>
<p><b>Development status</b>: proof of concept. Open source, under an MIT license</p>
<p><b>The core  idea:</b>
    <!--
    PrototypeJungle applications are built by a process of successive specialization of tree structures in which
    prototypical inheritance plays a central role.
    The steps of specialization are the components in the system.
     The  components can be stored separately, and assembly  can be managed via a UI.
    <a href="/tech#overview">Details</a> can be found in the technical documentation.-->

PrototypeJungle applications are
built by successive specialization  of tree structures. Central to this process is a tree-instantiation <a href="/tech#overview">operation</a> which is sort of like tree copy,
except that the new nodes inherit prototypically from  their counterparts in the old tree as <a href="/tech#instantiate">appropriate</a>.
The steps of specialization are themselves  <a href="/tech#components">components</a> in the system.
The  components can be stored separately, and assembled in code or via a UI. 
</p>
 
 
<p><b>The application area:</b> initial experiments involve data display using HTML5 canvas.
In this domain, trees represent computationally defined graphical objects, ranging in complexity from simple shapes, up through complete infographic assemblies (eg charts, flow diagrams).
Examples appear below, as shown in PrototypeJungle's <i>inspector</i>.</p>
<p>This inspector follows the
lead of the DOM inspectors that come with all modern browsers in that clicking on things displays 
the information structures which underly them - in this case JavaScript objects with their prototype chains and functions.
The objects can be
edited and saved in their modified form.
 Among other things, this
allows applications to be customized by non-programmers.</p>
