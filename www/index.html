<p><b>Development status</b>: proof of concept. Open source, under an MIT license</p>


<p><b>The core  idea:</b>
    <!--
    PrototypeJungle applications are built by a process of successive specialization of tree structures in which
    prototypical inheritance plays a central role.
    The steps of specialization are the components in the system.
     The  components can be stored separately, and assembly  can be managed via a UI.
    <a href="/tech#overview">Details</a> can be found in the technical documentation.-->

PrototypeJungle applications are
built by successive specialization  of tree structures. Central to this process is a tree-instantiation <a href="/tech#overview">operation</a> which is sort of like tree copy,
except that the new nodes inherit prototypically from  their counterparts in the old tree as <a href="/tech#instantiate">appropriate</a>.
The steps of specialization are themselves  <a href="/tech#components">components</a> in the system.
The  components can be stored separately, and assembled in code or via a UI. 
</p>
 
 
<p><b>The application area:</b> initial experiments involve data display using HTML5 canvas.
In this domain, trees represent computationally defined graphical objects, ranging in complexity from simple shapes, up through complete infographic assemblies (eg charts, flow diagrams).
Examples appear below, as shown in PrototypeJungle's <i>inspector</i>.</p>
<p>This inspector follows the
lead of the DOM inspectors that come with all modern browsers in that clicking on things displays 
the information structures which underly them - in this case JavaScript objects with their prototype chains and functions.
The objects can be
edited and saved in their modified form.
 Among other things, this
allows applications to be customized by non-programmers.</p>

 underlying the chart below. </p>

 <!--
<p style="font-size:12pt"><i>Before proceeding to the next example, let me  mention    something 
which is not as easily explained or demonstrated as the capabilities of the inspector,
but has a more general significance.  Namely, PrototypeJungle allows applications to
be built from components  by successive specialization (<a href="/tech#instantiate">implemented</a> as a kind of Object.create for trees).
Each separately stored
component provides a link or two in the prototype chains that represent the specialization. What is unusual is that these steps of successive instantiation are of a regular kind,that are managed
by UI - this is not only a coding technique.  Details can be found in the technical documentation.</i></p>

 <p>Now, another infographics example. Here the utility of inspectability/adjustabilty  starts to become evident. This depicts the trade flows in 2012, in billions of dollars, between the world's major economies, each labeled with its GDP for that year. </p>

 <p>An example which is nearly as simple as possible, with one prototype and two instances: </p>
 
 <div  class="itemImage" style="padding-bottom:40px">
  <div id="inspectSimple"  class="inspectButton">Inspect</div>

  <p>You can find an  abstract, fanciful example at <a href="/twoarcs">TwoArcs</a>,
  where serveral variants of the same underlying structure are shown, with differing parameters:</p>
