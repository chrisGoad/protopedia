<p><b>Development status</b>: proof of concept. Open source, under an MIT license</p>


<p><b>The core  idea:</b>
    PrototypeJungle applications are built by a process of successive specialization of tree structures in which
    prototypical inheritance plays a central role.
    The steps of specialization are the components in the system.
    They can be stored separately, and managed via a UI - this is not only a coding technique.
    <a href="/tech#overview">Details</a> can be found in the technical documentation.
    <!--
PrototypeJungle applications are
built by successive specialization  of tree structures. Central to this process is a tree-instantiation <a href="/tech#instantiate">operation</a> which is sort of like tree copy,
except that the new nodes inherit from from their counterparts in the old tree as appropriate.
The steps of specialization are themselves  components in the system. The  components can be stored separately, and assembly processes can be managed via a UI.
<a href="/tech#overview">Details</a> can be found in the technical documentation.

<p><b>The application area:</b> graphics in HTML5 canvas, with inspection.</p>
<p>Javascript developers are familiar with the inspectors
for the DOM that come with modern browsers.
 PrototypeJungle follows this lead, but applies its techniques to the realm of  graphical objects
 displayed in HTML5 canvas. Initial experiments involve infographics.</p><p>As in DOM inspectors, clicking on things displays the
 structures which underly them - in this case JavaScript objects. The objects are displayed with their 
 prototype chains and functions, and can be 
edited and saved in their modified form.
 Among other things, this
allows applications to be customized by non-programmers.
   </p>

   

 <p>You will see what this means immediately from an example: click the inspect button  to view and edit the JavaScript structures
 underlying the chart below. </p>
 
 

 <div  class="itemImage">
  <div id="inspectChart"  class="inspectButton">Inspect</div>
  <img src="http://s3.prototypejungle.org/sys/repo0/chart/images/BarChart/i0.jpg" alt="Bar Chart" width="500" style="border:solid thin black"/>
 </div>
 
 
 <!--
<p style="font-size:12pt"><i>Before proceeding to the next example, let me  mention    something 
which is not as easily explained or demonstrated as the capabilities of the inspector,
but has a more general significance.  Namely, PrototypeJungle allows applications to
be built from components  by successive specialization (<a href="/tech#instantiate">implemented</a> as a kind of Object.create for trees).
Each separately stored
component provides a link or two in the prototype chains that represent the specialization. What is unusual is that these steps of successive instantiation are of a regular kind,that are managed
by UI - this is not only a coding technique.  Details can be found in the technical documentation.</i></p>

 <p>Now, another infographics example. Here the utility of inspectability/adjustabilty  starts to become evident. This depicts the trade flows in 2012, in billions of dollars, between the world's major economies, each labeled with its GDP for that year. </p>

 <p>An example which is nearly as simple as possible, with one prototype and two instances: </p>
 
 <div  class="itemImage" style="padding-bottom:40px">
  <div id="inspectSimple"  class="inspectButton">Inspect</div>
  <img src="http://s3.prototypejungle.org/sys/repo0/examples/images/TwoRectangles/original.jpg" alt="Two Rectangles" width="500" style="border:solid thin black"/>
 </div>
 
  <p>You can find an  abstract, fanciful example at <a href="/twoarcs">TwoArcs</a>,
  where serveral variants of the same underlying structure are shown, with differing parameters:</p>
