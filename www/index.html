<div style="text-align:center;font-size:14pt;padding-top:10px;color:black"><b>JavaScript Prototypes in the Open</b></div>

<p> 
Prototypes play a central role in JavaScript, but are unseen except by coders. At least, end-users have had no systematic
view of this realm via user interfaces.
One reason: lack of uniform structure of the object graph within which the prototype chains appear.</p>
<p>The issue can be addressed by restricting attention to structures which are trees in their object/own-property/value aspect (but
which, unlike JSON objects, may contain prototype chains and functions). Then, via user interface, end-users can be given new powers,
namely access to all prototypes and instances underlying an application.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of an application built in this way: </p>

<img onclick = "location.href = 'http://prototypejungle.org/ui?intro=1&amp;source=http://prototypejungle.org/sys/repo3|example/bar_chart.js'" src="images/figure1.svg" style="border:none; cursor:pointer" width="500" height="130"/>


 <p> The chart, <a href="http://prototypejungle.org/ui?intro=1&amp;source=http://prototypejungle.org/sys/repo3|example/bar_chart.js">when viewed in the UI</a>,
manifests the complete adjustability that arises from the above-mentioned powers. <!--alluded to above. in that each  instance and prototype is subject to modification.-->
Of course, all kinds of adjustability
 can be built into user interfaces via application-specific coding, but in the case of PrototypeJungle, the treatment is uniform.</p>
 PrototypeJungle  provides a way of assembling such structures efficiently  via its component system.</p>
<!-- upporting end-user acccess.
The result:  new powers for end-users deriving from their access to the prototype realm.--> <p>The components are 
objects which obey the same structural rule as the whole application: they must be tree-like in their object/own-property/value aspect.
PrototypeJungle provides a serialization method, so the components can be stored.<!--
are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">serializable</a> trees within which prototype chains and functions appear.--> Components
may themselves serve as  prototypes, since
PrototypeJungle <a href="/doc/tech.html#instantiation_details">extends instantiation</a>, normally a one-level operation implemented
by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create">Object.create</a>
or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new">new</a>, to hierarchical structures.
The scheme results in highly adjustable applications, as has been seen in the example.</p>

<p>
 
Here is a diagram illustrating the structure of a component or application. </p>

 <p>Precisely stated: a red arrow runs from node a to
node b if Object.getPrototypeOf(a) === b. A black arrow runs from  a  to b  if a.P === b for some own property P of a.
The requirement is that the black and green subgraph (whose edges consist of object/own-property/value relationships), be
 a tree. 

 Such structures are dubbed, loosely but concisely, "prototype trees".
<a href="http://prototypejungle.org/doc/tech.html#prototypeTrees">Here</a> is a precise description</p>

<p>JavaScript libraries supporting the technology are available at this site (see the
<a href="doc/code.html">Coding Guide</a>), and all aspects of the implementation
are open source (at <a href="https://github.com/chrisGoad/prototypejungle/tree/r3">GitHub</a> under the MIT License).</p>
