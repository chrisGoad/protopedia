<div style="text-align:center;font-size:14pt;padding-top:10px;color:black"><b>Deep Prototypes as JavaScript Components</b></div>
 

<p>In normal JavaScript usage, the instantiation of a prototype
(creation of a new object which inherits from the prototype) is a one-level operation, implemented by
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create">Object.create</a>
or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new">new</a>.
PrototypeJungle <a href="/doc/tech.html#instantiation_details">extends instantiation</a> to hierarchical structures, so that
trees of arbitrary depth  serve  as templates from
which instances can be spawned at one blow. </p>

<p>The structures in question may incorporate behavior (functions/methods), and internal
prototype chains. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">Serialization</a> is also
<a href = "http://prototypejungle.org/doc/tech.html#serialize">supported</a>. 
 Together,
these capabilities  yield  a component system in which applications are built by instantiation and assembly
from stored elements. <!--The elements can be defined using all the powers of JavaScript,
subject only to the restriction to hierarchies.--> Here is diagram illustrating the component structure: </p>

 <img id="diagram" onclick = "location.href = 'http://prototypejungle.org/ui?item=/anon/repo3/bmecif83rc.js'" src="images/prototree.svg"
      style="bborder:thin black solid;cursor:pointer"  width="950" height="250"/>
<p style="margin-top:-130px">
 The central requirement is that the structure<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> be hierarchical in  its object-property-value aspect
 (the black and green subgraph).
 Such structures are dubbed, loosely but concisely, "prototype trees".
<a href="http://prototypejungle.org/doc/tech.html#prototypeTrees">Here</a> is a precise description</p>


<p>Charts have served as a proving ground for this approach, and the results are good.
Here is a simple chart: </p>
<img onclick = "location.href = 'http://prototypejungle.org/ui?intro=1&source=http://prototypejungle.org/sys/repo3|example/bar_chart.js'" src="images/figure1.svg" style="border:none; cursor:pointer" width="500" height="130"/>

<p> Click  on the chart  to inspect and adjust, and to observe its prototype structure.  The <a href="#diagram">above diagram</a> of a prototype tree has served as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">dogfood</a>
for PrototypeJungle. As with the chart,
<a href="http://prototypejungle.org/ui?item=/anon/repo3/c8jt5kchkr.js">click</a> to inspect.</p>
<!--
<p>The structures underlying the effort arise by restricting attention to hierarchies , as does  JSON,
but, unlike JSON, allowing prototype chains, and functions at the leaves.  Here is a picture:</p>

-->

<p>Complete application objects (eg charts) are themselves prototype trees, and as such have
a uniform structure which mates well with a uniform user interface. An initial stab at such an interface is the UI
seen in  the above example.
<!--However, the prototype-chain aspect is not relevant in every case to end-users.
A minor variant  of the inspector allows hiding of this aspect when irrelevant, or providing explanatory text
when it is. Click here to see the variant.--></p>
<p>JavaScript libraries supporting the techonology are available at this site (see the
<a href="doc/code.html">Coding Guide</a>), and all aspects of the implementation
are open source (at <a href="https://github.com/chrisGoad/prototypejungle/tree/r3">GitHub</a> under the MIT License).</p>
<!--
<p> An open drawing and charting application, in which visual elements and chart types could be
contributed by any web developer anywhere, is a possible application of the technology, which is at the proof-of-concept stage.</p>
