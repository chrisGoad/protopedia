<p> 
Prototypes play a central role in Javascript, but are unseen except by coders. 
 Prototype chains are
neither stored in JSON, nor exposed systematically in user interfaces<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>. They live invisibly within  running JavaScript invocations, and disappear when
 the invocations are complete. </p><!--p>This presents an opportunity, since  the pattern of a prototype and its instances forms an aspect of many content domains, an aspect which, if made visible and editable,  could  elucidate structure for non-programmers, and give them new powers. 
</p>-->
<p>This presents an opportunity. Many content domains can be structured in terms of prototypes and their instances. If this
aspect were made accessible in a user interface, it would give end users new powers, and if prototype chains could be serialized, new kinds of stored components would be  possible.</p>
 
<!--<p>It is not  hard to bring prototypes into open and serializable form, if the underlying object graph is restricted to tree form.
This is what PrototypeJung does. The resulting data structure, dubbed loosely but concisely, "a prototype tree", does a nice job
of capturing the inner form of infographs. </p>-->

<p><!--With PrototypeJungle, the  prototype dimension is brought into the open in serializable form,-->
ProtypeJungle investigates this opportunity. It brings the prototype dimension  into the open in serializable form.<!--
so that edits can be saved.--><!--allowing end users
to see and adjust this aspect of application structure in a user interface, and save the adjustments.--> This is made possible by restricting attention to hierarchical structures, as does  JSON,
but, unlike JSON, allowing prototype chains. Such structures are dubbed, loosely but concisely, "prototype trees".</p> <!--for hierachical structures like the one diagrammed below.</p>

<p><!--This is just what PrototypeJungle does.--> Charts have served as a proving ground for this approach, and the results are good.  Prototype trees nicely capture
the  inner structure of charts, and the availability of prototypes  in the UI makes the charts highly adjustable.

<p><i>A new version of  PrototypeJungle has been completed, but its installation at the site is not yet complete. For this brief interval, working examples will
not be available. When the installation is complete,   the graph below will link to its live counterpart, where you will see the prototype structure,
and be able to adjust all
elements. Please check back soon!</i></p>

 <p>Although only a few chart types have 
been treated so far, the same techniques will apply to infographs of a more general sort. </p>
 <p>As an aid to visual understanding, here is a diagram of  a prototype tree: </p>

 <img src="images/prototree.svg" style="bborder:thin black solid"  width="800" height="200"/>
<p style="margin-top:-80px">
 This structure<sup><a href="#footnote1">2</a></sup> qualifies as a prototype tree in virtue of the fact that its black/green  subgraph is a tree. Note that functions may appear at the leaves (but only there), another difference from JSON.</p>
<div id="serialization" class="introSection">Serialization</div> 
<p>
 <!--Prototype trees have other uses. -->Serialization, required in any case for saving adjustments, simplifies assembly from components by avoiding the need to reconstitute prototype chains. This is exploited in the charting implementation, where all elements, from individual marks (bubbles
,bars etc.), to more complex components such as axes or legends, through entire charts, are represented by prototype trees,
and stored as  such in the component library.</p>
<div id="instantiate" class="introSection">Instantiation</div>
<p>In normal JavaScript usage, the instantiation of a prototype
(creation of a new object which inherits from the prototype)
is a one-level operation, implemented by <i>Object.create</i> or <i>new</i>. PrototypeJungle provides a method for
instantiating an entire 
prototype tree at one blow.  As a result,
a prototype tree, regardless of how complex, can serve  as a template from
which instances can be spawned at will. In the charting application, this allows a prototype tree representing
an axis or legend, not just a simpler bar or bubble, 
to serve the fundamental role of a prototype as understood beyond the JavaScript context: namely, as a source of instances.
