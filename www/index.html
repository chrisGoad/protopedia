<p> 
Prototypes play a central role in JavaScript, but are unseen except by coders. 
 Prototype chains are
neither stored in JSON, nor exposed systematically in user interfaces<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>.  </p>
<p>There is a reason: lack of uniform structure of the object graph within which the prototype chains appear.
However, PrototypeJungle provides a way of building structures with the required regularity via its component system. The scheme results
in highly adjustable applications. Before explaining
how it works, here is a simple example:
 </p>

<img onclick = "location.href = 'http://prototypejungle.org/ui?intro=1&amp;source=http://prototypejungle.org/sys/repo3|example/bar_chart.js'" src="images/figure1.svg" style="border:none; cursor:pointer" width="500" height="130"/>


<p> The chart, <a href="http://prototypejungle.org/ui?intro=1&amp;source=http://prototypejungle.org/sys/repo3|example/bar_chart.js">when viewed in the UI</a>,
manifests complete adjustability in that each  instance and prototype is subject to modification.</p>

<p>The component system relies on hierarchic prototypes.
In normal JavaScript usage, the instantiation of a prototype
(creation of a new object which inherits from the prototype) is a one-level operation, implemented by
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create">Object.create</a>
or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new">new</a>.
PrototypeJungle <a href="/doc/tech.html#instantiation_details">extends instantiation</a> to hierarchic structures, so that
trees of arbitrary depth  serve  as templates from
which instances can be spawned at one blow.  </p>

<p>The structures in question may incorporate functions and internal
prototype chains. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">Serialization</a> is also
<a href = "http://prototypejungle.org/doc/tech.html#serialize">supported</a>. 
 Together,
these capabilities  yield  a component system in which applications are built by instantiation and assembly
from stored elements. After instantiation, the components, being prototypes, are still "live" - that is,
any adjustments are inherited by instances. </p>

<p>The assemblies have the  uniformity which allows the
prototypes chains to be exposed in a user interface.</p>
<!--  PrototypeJungle, however, imposes a simple restriction  that enables both a user interface, and serialization. The availability
  of the latter means 
  that applications can be built by assembly from stored components, yielding high adjustability, 
 since all elements of the prototype chains are systematically accessible to the user.</p>


<p>Charts have served as a proving ground for this approach, and the results are good.
Here is a simple chart: </p>-->
<p>
Here is a diagram illustrating the structure of a component. </p>

 <img id="diagram" onclick = "location.href = 'http://prototypejungle.org/ui?item=/anon/repo3/d454tg02bw.js'" src="images/prototree.svg"

<p style="margin-top:-130px">
  The  central requirement is that the structure<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> be hierarchic in  its object-property-value aspect
 (the black and green subgraph).

 Such structures are dubbed, loosely but concisely, "prototype trees".
<a href="http://prototypejungle.org/doc/tech.html#prototypeTrees">Here</a> is a precise description</p>

<p>JavaScript libraries supporting the technology are available at this site (see the
<a href="doc/code.html">Coding Guide</a>), and all aspects of the implementation
are open source (at <a href="https://github.com/chrisGoad/prototypejungle/tree/r3">GitHub</a> under the MIT License).</p>
