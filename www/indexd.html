<div style="text-align:center;font-size:14pt;top-padding:20px;color:black"><b>JavaScript Prototypes in the Open</b></div>
  
<p> 
Prototypes play a central role in JavaScript, but are unseen except by coders. 
 In current practice, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain#Inheritance_with_the_prototype_chain"> prototype chains</a> are 
neither stored in JSON, nor exposed systematically in user interfaces<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>. They live invisibly within  running JavaScript invocations, and disappear when
 the invocations are complete. </p>
<!--
<p>However, many content domains can be naturally structured in terms of prototypes and their instances. If this
aspect were made accessible in a user interface, it would give end users new powers, and if prototype chains could be serialized, new kinds of stored components would be  possible.</p>

 However, many content domains can be naturally structured in terms of prototypes and their instances.
ProtypeJungle exposes
  the prototype dimension
  in a user interface, giving end users new powers in these domains, and provides serialization for prototype chains,
 making new kinds of stored components possible.</p>
<p>This is done by restricting attention to hierarchical structures, as does  JSON,
but, unlike JSON, allowing prototype chains. Such structures are dubbed, loosely but concisely, "prototype trees".</p> 


<p> Charts have served as a proving ground for this approach, and the results are good.  Prototype trees nicely capture
the  inner structure of charts, and the availability of prototypes  in the UI makes the charts highly adjustable.

<p> Click  on the chart  to see and adjust its prototype structure.</p>
<!--
 <p>Although only a few chart types have 
been treated so far, the same techniques will apply to infographs of a more general sort. </p>
-->
 <p>As a visual aid to understanding, here is a diagram of  a prototype tree: </p>

<p style="margin-top:-80px">
 This structure<sup><a href="#footnote1">2</a></sup> qualifies as a prototype tree in virtue of the fact that its black/green  subgraph is a tree. Note that functions may appear at the leaves (but only there), another difference from JSON.</p>

<p>The prototype tree diagram has served as dogfood for PrototypeJungle.
You can see and adjust its prototype structure by clicking on the diagram.</p>

<div id="instantiate" class="introSection">Prototype Trees as Components</div>
<p>In normal JavaScript usage, the instantiation of a prototype
(creation of a new object which inherits from the prototype)
is a one-level operation, implemented by <i>Object.create</i> or <i>new</i>. PrototypeJungle provides a method for
instantiating an entire 
prototype tree at one blow.  As a result,
a prototype tree, regardless of how complex, can serve  as a template from
which instances can be spawned at will. In the charting application, this allows  prototype trees representing
an axis or legend, not just a simpler bar or bubble, to serve as the components from which charts are built.
