<div style="text-align:center;font-size:14pt;top-padding:20px;color:black"><b>Prototype Trees as Components in JavaScript</b></div>
  
  
 <p>Suppose that any part of a JavaScript object graph could be serialized, and could serve
 as a prototype for spawning instances in the sense that Object.create spawns instances of a single object.
 A very expressive component system would
 result, since applications could be assembled from stored libraries of components by instantiation and
 assembly, and all the powers of JavaScript would be available in the implementation of components.
 This is not possible as stated, but a simple restriction brings us close. Namely, let us restrict attention
 to structures that are hierachical in the sense that a spanning tree is specified, but in which
 prototype chains and functions are retained.
 PrototypeJungle implements instantiation and serialization for just such structures.
 Here is a picture:</p>


 <img onclick = "location.href = 'http://prototypejungle.org/uid?item=/anon/repo3/c8jt5kchkr.js'" src="images/prototree.svg" style="bborder:thin black solid;cursor:pointer"  width="800" height="200"/>
<p style="margin-top:-80px">
 
 <p> Such structures are dubbed, loosely but consisely, "prototype trees"; the above title used the term
 "deep prototype", which is more descriptive prior to explanation.</p>
  Here is a precise description of the constraints.</p>

<p> Charts have served as a proving ground for this approach, and the results are good.
Here is a simple chart: </p>


<img onclick = "location.href = 'http://prototypejungle.org/uid?intro=1&source=http://prototypejungle.org/sys/repo3|example/bar_chart.js'" src="images/figure1.svg" style="border:none; cursor:pointer" width="500" height="130"/>

<p> Click  on the chart  to inspect and adjust it. </p></p>

<p>Complete application objects (eg charts) are themselves prototype trees, and as such have
a uniform structure which mates well with a uniform user interface. One such interface is the inspector
seen in the context of the above example.
However, the prototype-chain aspect is not relevant in every case to end-users.
A minor variant  of the inspector allows hiding of this aspect when irrelevant, or providing explanatory text
when it is. Click here to see the variant.</p>
<p> An open drawing and charting application, in which visual elements and chart types could be
contributed by any web developer anywhere, is a possible application of the technology, which is at the proof-of-concept stage.</p>
