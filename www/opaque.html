<p>
    <p>A program is an opaque object except (maybe) to a programmer.
    <!--Because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">Turing</a>, anything at all could be going on in  code, and there is no uniform way of finding out except for reading and understanding it.
    
    
    -->However, there are families of computation  whose underlying structure 
    can be exposed via UI to  non-programmers.
    The effort of formulating and exposing this kind of structure  sometimes brings large rewards.
     The cannonical example: consider a piece of code
    that performs a financial computation compared to a spreadsheet  with the same purpose.  Exactly the same computational steps might be
    involved in a calculation, but by exposing the structure outwardly, powers are given to everyone.</p>
    <p>
   Another example, recently in <a href="http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/10/transformative-programming.html">vogue</a>,
    though with a long history:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming">Flow-based programming</a> arises from the observation
   that many kinds of computation can be formulated as flows of messages between  active nodes of  a graph, and 
 from  the utility of making the graph visible. </p>
    
    <p> There is another benefit: the common structure, once formulated,
    can generally be given an external representation, allowing transmission and assembly. 
    <p>Prototype chains constitute a general structure that underlies all JavaScript computations.
    So far, they  have  been hidden in the code.
    But chains might make sense to many non-programmers, if they could see them.
    After all, the idea that some things are specialized variants of others (firs are connifers are trees) is part of
    general cognition, not programming expertise. </p><p>  A major purpose of PrototypeJungle is to run this experiment.  
    More is required
    the intention  to expose chains, if they are embedded in an otherwise tangled structure. It turns out, however, that by 
    that the restriction to embedding chains in a tree  works well, and closes the gap to a form that
    is fully amenable to presentation in a UI.</p>
    <p>However this experiment turns out, the component machinery is a seperate benefit. Seeing the chains might be useful to programmers too, in so far
    as it provides a new view of an application.</p>
