<p><span style="text-align:left;font:bold 12pt arial">Prototype Jungle:</span>  tools for inspecting, editing and saving things built in Javascript.</center>
<p> Here is a  quick outline of the modules making up the Prototype Jungle code base. The first few (om, instantiate, externalize) define the object model, and provide methods
for saving and restoring items.  jquery defines DOM objects, and geom, geometric objects, in the jungle style. draw renders geometric objects using HTML5 canvas, and
tree renders a hierarchy usind DOM primitives. The modules are described in more detail below.</p>

<p><b>om</b></p>

<p>In order to allow hierarchical browsing of  an application, a tree structure must given to the part of the application which
will appear in the browser. The object model includes
prototypes DNode (dictionary node), and LNode (list node) for this purpose. These nodes differ in that their children are named by sequential integers
starting with zero in the LNode case, and by strings in the DNode case.  Here is a code snippet which defines a simple tree: </p>


<b>  instantiate</b>

The  DNode.instantiate  takes a tree T, and creates a new one T', with the same parent/child structure, but where each new node N' in T' has the corresponding
node N in T as its
prototype. That is, instantiate is the Javascript function Object.create, mapped over a tree. Simple as it is, this is the core operation of the
system, by which non-atomic structures are built from prototypes. Here is a simple code snippet, which takes a Rectangle, and builds another with the
same attributes, but red, rather than blue. </p>


<b>externalize</b>
<p>
Jungle objects can be saved externally,  with their prototype structures and functions  intact. If an item is restored from
a file,  information about its origin is retained. If new objects are instantiated from prototypes from file F,   and the new objects are
in turn stored externally in F', F' will record the prototype links back into F as external references, without copying. In this manner libraries of
prototypes can be built for use in varied circumstances.  The prototype chain for a Prototype Jungle application object might have elements from several separate
files.
</p>





for the DOM that come with modern browsers. 
 Prototype Jungle applies a similar technique to the Javascript object graph itself, with its prototype chains and
 functions included, supporting browsing, editing, and saving of application objects.    </p>

 <p> Example: click the inspect button  to view and edit the JavaScript structures
 underlying the chart below.
 
 Here are more abstract, fanciful examples, each is a variant of the same underlying structure, with differing parameters.
