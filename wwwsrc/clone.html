<p><b>Cloning</b> When you select an
element, the clone button in the left hand panel will be enabled. After clicking "clone",
you can add a series of clones of the selected element with clicks in the graphics panel (cloning mode
persists until you click "Done Cloning" in the left panel). <!--The advantage of clones is that
their properties can be adjusted communally via their prototype, as explained here.--></p>
<p><b>Exercise</b>: Try cloning and the circle and square, each at least twice, and then adjusting one of the circles.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Each insert has its own prototype.</p>

<p>A useful style of work in building a diagram is
to first drag in one of each of the kinds of elements wanted (eg one  lozenge text box, and one rectanglular text box for a flowchart), and
 use cloning to generate as many instances of these items as wanted.</p>

<p>When an item is selected, and the action "Clone => Replace" in the left panel is clicked, this has the effect that each
subsequently clicked (and compatible) item will be replaced by a clone of the selected item.</p>

<p><b>Exercise</b>: Select a circle, then "Clone => Replace". Then click on a few squares, and observe  them turn into circles.</p>
