<!--
<p>  This site explains the prototypes-for-all idea  and shows how it plays
out in simple situations.
There is as yet no complete tool or product based on the idea.
However, the implementation of the core functionality is stable, and can serve
as a basis for experimentation by anyone with an interest, as explained in the coding guide.
