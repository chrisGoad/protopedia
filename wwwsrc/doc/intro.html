Every element of the chart is adjustable with a click. Many are draggable and resizable, for example,
the labels "Gold", "Silver", etc. </div>
<div class="intro">
The Up and Down buttons that appear above the graphics can be used to move up and down the containment hierarchy.
For example, after clicking "Gold", if you click "Up", a resizer for the entire chart will appear.  Try rezising
the chart.</div>

The right-hand panel displays properties of the selected object, and its prototype if any. Here's
an explanation of the role of prototypes.</div>-->
<div class="intro"> <span style="color:red">Prototypes</span>
Many of the elements of the chart are derived from an adjustable
<span style="color:blue;cursor:pointer;text-decoration:underline" onclick="parent.location.href='/doc/inherit.html'">prototype</span>. <!-- In these cases,
each individual (eg an individual bar) derives some properties from the prototype, and some are particular to the
individual.
In the case of bars, the height, width, and position are computed for each bar by the chart-generator, but the fill color,
stroke color, and stroke width are derived from the common prototype of the bars (barP). 
When the selected object is derived from a prototype-->
The right-hand panel displays properties of the selected object, and its prototype if adjustable. 
</div> 
<div class="intro">
For example, if you click on a bar, you can adjust the fill color of either the individual bar, or its prototype. In the latter case,
 all of the bars will turn
that color (try it). </div>

<div  class="intro">A shape that represents a data point
is called a "mark". In this case, the marks are bars, and the top-bar option "Alternate Marks" allows you to change
the bars into shiny or rounded variants. Other entries on the top-bar and in the file menu should be
 self-explanatory.
</div>


<div class="intro">
If you resize one of the labels, it is the prototype that gets resized by default. However, when the
adjustment is underway, checkboxes labeled "adjusting this" appear next to each item in the right-hand panel, allowing
you to change which element of the prototype chain  is being adjusted. </div>
