<p><b>Prototypes</b></p>
   <p>In case you're curious: this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_graph" target="_top">Cayley diagram</a> of the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group" target="_top">dihedral group</a> D3 - the symmetries of an isolateral triangle. </p>
 
<p>Try clicking on one of the circles.
As a consequence, its own properties and those of its prototype  are displayed in two boxes in the right-hand panel.
All of the circles are derived from the same prototype. Prototypes are a core feature of JavaScript, but you don't need to be
a programmer to understand them, nor to use PrototypeJungle.
Here is a <a href="/doc/inherit.html" target="_top">programming-free explanation.</a></p>

<p>Having selected a circle,  if you edit the fill property of the
prototype, all circles with the same prototype change color, whereas editing the fill of the  "selected item" affects only the circle you selected.
Note that you can drag the circles around, and resize them. In both cases, arrows are adjusted accordingly.<!--If you zoom in on a selected circle, and then select it,a resizer appears, and
you can modify the circle size with a drag on the resizer. (Resizers only appear for shapes that appear big enough in the graphics).-->
By default, the
prototype is resized, but you can also resize individual circles, by checking the "Adjusting this" check box at the top of the "Selected item"
panel. </p>

<p> The arrows  are  also derived from a common prototype. Try selecting an arrow and adjusting it.</p>

<p>The shapes that share a prototype are called "clones". Select a circle, then click "show clones" in the panel to the
left of the graphics; all clones of the circle will be highlighted.</p>

<p>The Up and Down buttons that appear above the graphics can be used to move up and down the containment hierarchy.
For example, after clicking a circle or arrow, if you click "Up", properties of the containing vertex or edge list will
appear. In this case, no edits are available at the containing level.
