<div class="pageTitle">Build an Adjustable Network Diagram with Code</div>


<p>This simple diagram <span style="position:relative;top:5px"><img height="20px" src = "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-5150272850535855811.appspot.com/o/twitter%3A14822695%2FforMainPage%2Flogo.svg?alt=media"> </a> </span> is implemented by the following code:</p>

<precode>

pj.require('/diagram/graph.js','/shape/circle.js','/shape/arcArrow.js',function (graphP,circlePP,arrowPP) {
  var geom = pj.geom,svg = pj.svg,ui = pj.ui;
  var item = svg.Element.mk('<g/>');// the root of the diagram we are assembling
  var graph = item.set('graph',graphP.instantiate());
  var circleP = graph.installAsVertexPrototype(circlePP);
  var arrowP = graph.installAsEdgePrototype(arrowPP);
  circleP.r = 12;
  circleP.fill = 'blue';
  var circle1 = graph.addVertex();
  var circle2 = graph.addVertex();
  circle1.__moveto(geom.Point.mk(-50,0));
  circle2.__moveto(geom.Point.mk(50,0));
  // set the parameters of the edge prototype
  arrowP.stroke = 'orange';
  arrowP.radius = 1; // radius of the arc as a multiple of arrow length
  arrowP.tailGap = 7; // gap between tail of arrow and its designated start point
  arrowP.headGap = 7; // gap between head of arrow and its designated end
  arrowP.solidHead = false;
  graph.connectVertices(circle1,circle2);
  graph.connectVertices(circle2,circle1);
  return item;
});

</precode>

 
 <p> <a href="/draw.html?source=/example/simpleDiagramAsGraph.js&intro=code_intro">Here</a> is the diagram in the drawing UI, in which it can be adjusted and extended, and in the  <a href="/code.html?source=/example/simpleDiagramAsGraph.js">code editor</a>, where you can experiment with the code.</p>
 
 
 <p>This example illustrates building a  diagram using operations defined by its diagram type. Diagram types are external components,
 rather than anything built into  the PrototypeJungle platform itself. The platform allows adding as many diagram types as as you like, each with its own API. In this case the diagram type is a network - a collection of nodes
 connected by arrows or lines, defined in <cw>/diagram/graph.js</cw>. Such a structure is  referred to as a <i>graph</i> in mathematical terminology. In this terminology the nodes are called "vertices"
 and the connectors "edges" - a terminology adopted in the API.</p>
 
 <p>Now, lets walk through the code.</p>
 
  <precode>
    pj.require('/diagram/graph.js','/shape/circle.js','/shape/arcArrow.js',function (graphP,circlePP,arrowPP) {
</precode>
  <p>
<i><b>pj</b></i>: The PrototypeJungle implementation is installed under one global variable,  <cw>prototypeJungle</cw>.
A shorter synonym for that global, <cw>pj</span>, is also available. If you need <cw>pj</span> for other purposes,
it can be freed by calling <cw>prototypeJungle.noConflict()</span>
(this is analogous to <a href="https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/">jQuery.noConflict()</a>, which frees up $). 
</p>

<p> To continue:
 <precode>
    pj.require('/diagram/graph.js','/shape/circle.js','/shape/arcArrow.js',function (graphP,circlePP,arrowPP) { ...

 </precode>
 binds the variables <cw>graphP</cw>, <cw>circlePP</cw> and  <cw>arrowPP</span> to the components defined in <cw>'/diagram/graph.js'</span>, <cw>'/shape/circle.js'</span>, and
 <cw>'/shape/arcArrow.js'</span>, respectively. Moving on:</p>

<precode>
    var item = svg.Element.mk('&lt;g/&gt;');// the root of the diagram we are assembling
</precode>

 

<p><cw>pj.svg.Element.mk</span> creates a prototype tree from
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVG</a> markup.</p>

<precode>
    var graph = item.set('graph',graphP.instantiate());
</precode>

<p> installs an instantiation of the graph component under the root. Instantiation, a fundamental operation in
PrototypeJungle, is explained <a href = "/doc/tech.html#instantiation_summary">here</a>.</p><p>
<cw>item.set('name',ch)</cw>  has the effect of <cw>item.name = ch</cw>, but also assigns <cw>item</cw> as the parent of
<cw>ch</cw> (PrototypeJungle items are trees, as explained
<a href="/doc/code.html#trees">here</a>).
</p>

<precode>
    var circleP = graph.installAsVertexPrototype(circlePP);
</precode>

<p>This defines the prototype that will be used for vertices in this graph as a circle. Note that installAsVertexPrototype is a method
of  the graph component, defined externally to the PrototypeJungle platform.</p>


<precode>
    var arrowP = graph.installAsVertexPrototype(arrowPP);
</precode>

<p> has similar effect.</p>

<precode>
    var circle1 = graph.addVertex();
</precode>

<p>  instantiates the vertex prototype assigned by installAsVertexPrototype.</p>

<precode>
  circle1.__moveto(geom.Point.mk(-50,0));
</precode>

<p> moves the resulting circle to the given position. __moveto and geom.Point.mk are operations defined by the platform.</p>

<p>circle2 is created and moved analogously.</p>

<precode>
 graph.connectVertices(circle1,circle2);
</precode>  
  <p>instantiates the edge prototype (in this case an arrow), and connects its ends to circle1 and circle2 respectively.
  <cw>graph.connectVertices(circle2,circle1);</cw> runs an arrow in the other direction.</p>
