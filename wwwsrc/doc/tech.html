<p>In normal JavaScript usage, the instantiation of a prototype 
(creation of a new object which inherits from the prototype) is a one-level operation, implemented by
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create">Object.create</a>
or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new">new</a>.
PrototypeJungle
<a href="/doc/tech.html#instantiate">extends instantiation</a>
to hierarchical structures, so that
trees of arbitrary depth  serve  as templates from
which instances can be spawned at one blow.  Such trees will be referred to as <b>"deep prototypes"</b>.</p>

<p>The structures in question may incorporate functions and internal
prototype chains.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">Serialization</a> is also
<a href = "/doc/tech.html#serialize">supported</a>.
 Together,
these capabilities  yield  a component system in which applications are built by instantiation and assembly
from stored elements. After instantiation, the components, being prototypes, are still
"<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline">live</span>" - that is,
any adjustments are inherited by instances. The assemblies have a uniform structure which mates
well to a user interface in which prototype structure is exposed.
</p>

<p>Here is a diagram illustrating the component structure: </p>

<p style="margin-top:-30px">
 The central requirement is that the structure<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> be hierarchic in  its object-property-value aspect
 (the black and green subgraph).
 <!--(<i>hierarchic prototype</i> is a little clearer, but a mouthful)-->

The remaining sections  cover  internals which needn't be plumbed for most coding purposes. </i>

</div>
<div class="section" id="definition">2.Definition</div>

<p>Here is a precise definition of the deep prototype structure.</p>

<p>1) Start with  a JavaScript tree of 
the kind that is expressable in JSON, but allowing, unlike JSON, functions as leaves. Such a structure lacks prototypical inheritance, except from
the Javascript core items:  <cw>Object.prototype </cw>,  <cw>Function.prototype</cw>, and  <cw>Array.prototype</cw>.<p>



<p>2) Next, allow prototype chains in the tree. This places another sort of graph over the first.
It has the same nodes as the original tree, but adds a new set of edges - 
 edges which join nodes <cw>A</cw> and <cw>B</cw> if
<cw>B</cw> is the prototype of <cw>A</cw>.  This second graph is  acyclic too, but is rarely connected. 
</p>
<p>
3) Add a special property <cw>__parent</cw>, where if there is a tree-edge from node <cw>A</cw> to node <cw>B</cw>, 
<cw>B.__parent === A</cw>.  There is a tree-edge from  <cw>A</cw> to  <cw>B</cw>
if the value of some own property  <cw>P</cw> on  <cw>A</cw> is  <cw>B</cw>,
or if  <cw>A</cw> is an array, and <cw>B</cw> is an element of  <cw>A</cw>. As a convenience for coding,
the special property  <cw>__name</cw> is added too, such that whenever  <cw>B.__parent === A</cw>,
and  <cw>A.P === B</cw> with  <cw>P</cw> an own property of  <cw>A, B.__name === P</cw></p>

<p>
4) Now that the  <cw>__parent</cw> property explicitly picks out the tree, we can allow cross tree links.
That is we allow  <cw>A.P = B</cw> for any two nodes in
the tree.

</p>

<p>Deep prototypes are also referred to as "items"</p>

<div class="section" id="instantiate">2. Instantiation</div>

<p>In normal JavaScript usage, the instantiation of a prototype
(creation of a new object which inherits from the prototype)
is a one-level operation, implemented by <i>Object.create</i> or <i>new</i>. PrototypeJungle provides a method
for
instantiating an entire 
deep prototype T at one blow.</p>
<p>The algorithm is specified in detail below, but understanding this level of detail is  not required to make use of the operation
in coding; in practice, one might say, "it does the right thing".</p>

<p>Let <span class="codeWord">T</span>' = <span class="codeWord">T.instantiate()</span>.
Then <span class="codeWord">T</span>' is a treewise copy of <span class="codeWord">T</span>,
but initially <!--(see the <a href="#lastStep">step</a> below)--> omits its atomic-valued properties, 
which <span class="codeWord">T</span>' will acquire by inheritance.  <span class="codeWord">T</span>' also has the same prototype structure as <span class="codeWord">T</span>, except that chains in <span class="codeWord">T</span>' are anchored back in <span class="codeWord">T</span>.
The exact situation is this: consider corresponding nodes <span class="codeWord">N</span> and <span class="codeWord">N</span>' in <span class="codeWord">T</span> and <span class="codeWord">T</span>', that is, nodes appearing at the same paths from the roots of <span class="codeWord">T</span> and <span class="codeWord">T</span>'.
Now consider the prototypes <span class="codeWord">P</span> and <span class="codeWord">P</span>' of <span class="codeWord">N</span> and <span class="codeWord">N</span>', that is, <span class="codeWord">P</span> and <span class="codeWord">P</span>' where
<span class="code">P=Object.getPrototypeOf(N)</span> and <span class="code">P'=Object.getPrototypeOf(N')</span>. There
are two cases. First, <span class="codeWord">P</span> might lie within <span class="codeWord">T</span>. Then <span class="codeWord">P</span>' is defined to be the corresponding node to <span class="codeWord">P</span>, treewise (ie the one at the same path). Second,
<span class="codeWord">P</span> might lie outside of the tree <span class="codeWord">T</span>.  Then <span class="codeWord">P</span>' is set to <span class="codeWord">N</span> itself. This is what I mean when I say that prototype chains in <span class="codeWord">T</span>' are anchored in <span class="codeWord">T</span>. If you follow
a prototype chain <span class="codeWord">C</span>' in <span class="codeWord">T</span>', it will pass through nodes at the same paths as those of the corresponding chain <span class="codeWord">C</span> in <span class="codeWord">T</span>,
as long as it is within the tree, but where it exits the tree, then it is 
anchored back over in <span class="codeWord">T</span> at the node in <span class="code">T</span> from which the exit node in
<span class="code">T</span>' was copied. </p>
<p id="lastStep">There is one more step in the algorithm. Consider again the case where
<span class="codeWord">P</span>, the prototype of <span class="codeWord">N</span>, lies within <span class="codeWord">T</span>.
Then, as described above, <span class="codeWord">N</span>' will inherit from <span class="codeWord">P</span>', not <span class="codeWord">N</span>.
In this case, the algorithm specifies that  the own atomic properties of <span class="codeWord">N</span> be copied to <span class="codeWord">N</span>', since
otherwise they would be, in a sense, lost.</p> 

<p>Here is a simple example. <cw>iii</cw> is the initial tree.
The red arrow <cw>b</cw> <span style="color:red;"><span style="font-size:10pt;position:relative;top:-1px">---</span><span style="position:relative;top:1px">&gt;</span></span>
<cw>a</cw> means that <cw>Object.getPrototypeOf(b)===a</cw>.</p>
<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-5150272850535855811.appspot.com/o/twitter%3A14822695%2FforDocs%2FinstantiateDiagram1.svg?alt=media" style="border:none" width="200" height="140"/> 
<!--<img src="/images/instantiate1.svg" style="border:none" width="200" height="140"/> -->

<p>Then after,</p>
<pre><code>
jjj = iii.instantiate();
jjj.a.y = 4;
</code></pre>
<p>we have: </p> 
<!-- <img src="/images/instantiate2.svg" style="border:none" width="500" height="200"/>-->
<img style="mmargin-top:-10px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-5150272850535855811.appspot.com/o/twitter%3A14822695%2FforDocs%2FinstantiateDiagram2.svg?alt=media" style="border:none" width="250" heightt="200"/>

<p>
So, eg,
<cw>jjj.b.x === 1</cw>,
since <cw>jjj.b</cw> inherits from <cw>jjj.a</cw>, which in turn inherits from <cw>iii.a</cw>.
Note that <cw>jjj.b.z</cw> has been copied from <cw>iii.b.z</cw>, by the last-mentioned
<a href="#lastStep">step</a> of the algorithm mentioned above.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/chrisGoad/prototypejungle/blob/master/js/core/instantiate.js">Here</a> is the implementation.</p>
 

<div class="section" id="ammendment">3. An Ammendment</div>

<p>Until now, one aspect of  the implementation  has been supressed for simplicity of exposition, but it is time to correct this.
Deep prototypes as described so far
contain interior nodes which either inherit prototype-wise from elsewhere in the tree, from components, or are basic objects {}, or arrays [].
This is not quite right.  Instead of using plain object and arrays, we instead introduce prototypes:</p>


<pre>
  
pj.Object = {};

pj.Array = [];
</pre>

<p>
To construct a new node for use in an item, the primitives
</p>
<pre>
  
pj.Object.mk = function () {return Object.create(pj.Object)}

pj.Array.mk = function () {return Object.create(pj.Array)}

</pre>
<p>
are defined. (Note that <cw>Object.create</cw> is used here, and not any form of <cw>new</cw>.
This <cw>new</cw>-avoidance is a general PrototypeJungle policy, as explained
<a href="/doc/code.html#nonews">here</a>). This means that we can define tree operations on <cw>pj.Object</cw> and
<cw>pj.Array</cw> without polluting the basic JavaScript name spaces <cw>Object.prototype</cw> and
<cw>Array.prototype</cw>. Such pollution would affect all JavaScript objects and arrays, not just the ones used in the
PrototypeJungle implementation.
</p>
<p>

A final, and very useful, generalization can be made.  
The installation of the 
PrototypeJungle code base, assigned to <cw>window.prototypeJungle</cw>, is itself an item.
For any object <cw>Y</cw> in this tree, it is possible to use
<cw>Object.create(Y)</cw> as an interior node of the item that we are constructing. In <a href="#serialize">serialization</a>,
<cw>Y</cw> is represented by its path within
<cw>window.prototypeJungle</cw>,
eg "/Object" or "/svg/tag/g". That is, items can be built over nodes derived by inheritance from arbitrary nodes in
<cw>window.prototypeJungle</cw>.

</p>

<p>
This ammendment has no effect on the basic definitions. As always,
an item is
defined as a pair of graphs over the same set of nodes, graphs given by two sorts of edges: own-property-value edges, and
isPrototypeOf edges.
The former graph, as always,
is restricted to be a tree.  Before the ammendment, interior nodes either inherited from another node in a tree,  or from
<cw>Array.prototype</cw> or <cw>Object.prototype</cw>,
or from a component.
Now, interior nodes can inherit from any object in the PrototypeJungle installation as well.

<div  class="section" id="serialize">4. Serialization</div>

<p style="padding-bottom:30px">Serialization of deep prototypes is essential to their
use as components. This capability is implemented by assigning numeric codes to the nodes of the object
graph to be serialized, and then building a JSON-compatible description of the graph. This description, for example,
lists the object-valued properties of a node
through use of the codes for the values of those properties, and represents prototype chains as arrays of the codes of nodes in the chain.
 A detailed description of the algorithm and format appears with the
<a  href="https://github.com/chrisGoad/prototypejungle/blob/master/js/core/serialize.js">implementation</a>.
