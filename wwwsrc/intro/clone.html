<p><b>Cloning</b></p><p> A clone of item X is a new item instantiated from the prototype of X. When you select an
element, the clone button in the left hand panel will be enabled. After clicking "clone",
you can add a series of clones of the selected element with clicks in the graphics panel (cloning mode
persists until you click "Done Cloning" in the left panel). <!--The advantage of clones is that
their properties can be adjusted communally via their prototype, as explained here.--></p>
<p><b>Exercise</b>: Try cloning and the circle and square, each at least twice, and then adjusting one of the circles.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Each insert has its own prototype.</p>

<p>A useful style of work in building a network diagram is
to first construct one of each of the kinds of elements wanted
(eg for a flowchart: one  lozenged text box, and one ordinary  text box), and
 use cloning to generate as many instances of these items as wanted.</p>
