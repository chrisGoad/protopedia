<p><b>Cohorts</b> Occasionally,  it is convenient to modify the prototype structure of a diagram.
That is what the "Split Cohort" and "Add to Cohort" operations do. Reminder: a "cohort" is a set of items
that have the same prototype. For example, all of the circles to the right belong to one cohort, while
the squares belong to two (the upper squares to one cohort, and the lower squares to another). You can verify this by selecting one of the circles or squares, and then clicking
"Show Cohort". Or you can modify the fill color of the prototype of a circle or square, and see which
items change.</p>

<p>If you click "Split cohort" after selecting a circle, the items in the cohort of that circle will be highlighted.
By clicking on a series of these highlighted items, you define a new cohort, with its own new prototype, that is
split off from the original.</p><p> <b>Exercise:</b> Try it, and then verify that the split-off cohort does in fact have its own prototype.
</p>

<p>If you select a circle, and then click "Add to cohort", you may thereafter click on arbitrary items outside of the
the circle's cohort, and as you click them, these items will be added one by one to the circle's cohort. This means that the
added items are, as it were, spliced onto the circle's prototype - that is, they now inherit from the circle's prototype.
Of course, when this happens, the added items become circles  - but tranfer over what ever properties they may have
had in their former life. </p><p> <b>Exercise:</b> Try adding a few squares to a circle's cohort.
