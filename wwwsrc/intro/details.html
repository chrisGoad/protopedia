<p><b>Connector Details</b></p>
  

<p><b>Multi-connectors</b>. Addition of  connectors with more than one input or output
requires a different procedure than applies to the simpler binary connectors, such
as arrows or lines. To add a multi connector, drag it to the desired position, and also drag its inputs and outputs so that they are
adjacent 
to or within the vertices where a connections are desired. The inputs and outputs need not be placed exactly.
Then  "connect multi" operation invoked from  the
left hand panel will effect the connection (and will automatically move the inputs and outputs to the exact positions for connection).
This connect multi option will appear whenever a multi connector is selected.</p>

<p><b>Exercise:</b> Select the multi-connector, then click "connect multi" in the left panel. Drag the circles and square around,
and observe that the connection has been made.</p>
