<p><b>Diagrammatic Elements</b></p>
  
<p>So far, you have seen how how to build diagrams by hand from relatively simple elements like circles and arrows.
But PrototypeJungle allows for more complex kinds of elements - complete diagrams, with   one-click
operations which support quick construction of the desired diagram of its type from the seed found in the catalog.
For example, consider the tree diagram:

<img id="tree" width = "100" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-5150272850535855811.appspot.com/o/twitter%3A14822695%2FforCatalog%2Ftree.svg?alt=media"/>

<p><b>Exercise</b> Insert this tree from the catalog (found under the "diagram" tab). </p>

<p>Having inserted the tree, select any node. Note that among the operations available in the left panel is "Add Child".  Try it.
A child node will be added under the selected node. Nodes can be dragged around, and replaced with other shapes, such as squares
or text boxes - either one-by-one or as a group (with  "replace prototype").  The "reposition subtree" operation can be used at any
time to algorithmically position the nodes in the tree in a regular way that avoids overlap. With these operations, a tree like this
</p>
<img id="tree" width = "200" src=
"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-5150272850535855811.appspot.com/o/twitter%3A14822695%2FforDocs%2FtreeExample.svg?alt=media">

<p>can be built in minutes. The same principles apply to other kinds of diagram seeds found in the catalog.</p>
