<p><b>Introduction </b></p>
 

<p> <b>Prototypes</b>:
Try clicking on one of the circles. As a consequence, its own properties and those of its prototype are displayed in two boxes in the right-hand panel. All of the circles are derived from the same prototype. Prototypes are a core feature of JavaScript, but you don't need to be a programmer to understand them, nor to use PrototypeJungle.
Here is a <a href="/doc/inherit.html" target="_top">programming-free explanation.</a></p>
<p>Having selected a circle, if you edit the fill property of the prototype, all circles with the same prototype change color, whereas editing the fill of the "selected item" affects only the circle you selected. Note that you can drag the circles around, and resize them. In both cases, arrows are adjusted accordingly. By default, the prototype is resized, but you can also resize individual circles, by checking the "Adjusting this" check box at the top of the "Selected item" panel.
</p>

<p><b>Replacement</b> Clicking on "replace" in the top bar puts the catalog in replace mode. In this mode, a catalog of visual elements appears at the right of the screen. Dragging an element from the catalog over the element to be replaced, and then dropping, effects the replacement. Try replacing a circle with a square. Replace prototype in the top bar has a similar effect, but replaces all items sharing the prototype with the target of the drop.</p>
<!--
<p>Different items have different roles and only items with compatible roles allow replacement. As you drag over them, replaceable items will be highlighted. If you drag a simple shape (such as a lozenge or circle) over a text box, it is the box, not the text, that will be replaced - because of the compatibility of roles. Using this method, all simple shapes can be swapped in as the "box" in a text box.</p>
-->

<p><b>Diagrams</b>Note that when you select a circle, the left-hand panel changes as well, and displays, among other things,
the option "Add Child".  Try it.
A child node will be added under the selected node.  Also, the "reposition subtree" operation can be used at any
time to algorithmically position the nodes in the tree in a regular way that avoids overlap. Each kind of diagram
has its own set of operations (and JavaScript programmers can add their own).</p>
