<div><b>Network Diagrams</b></div>

<p> Unlike the tree diagram in the introduction, a network diagram is a free-form collection of nodes connected by arrows
which you populate "by hand". To add new nodes, select the "insert" mode from the top bar, and drag catalog elements into
the graphics panel. Try inserting a few circles. New connections can be added in the following way: select any of the circles that you
have added. Note that "connect" appears as an option in the action menu on the left side of the screen. Click on connect, then select another shape.
An arrow connecting the shapes will appear. Like nodes, the connectors can be changed with "replace" or "replace prototype". Try dragging
the circles around, or resizing them. Note that the arrows follow along. There are multi-connectors too, of the kind seen in the example just below. <a href="/draw.html?source=(sys)/intro/details.item&intro=details" target="_top"> Here</a> are the details. </p>

<!--But you can also select the element from the catalog,
and then drag out a box in the graphics panel with the desired dimensions (this is convenient for things like arrows).
Most are resizable: click on the catalog
entry of interest, then drag out a box in the graphics panel for inserting that element with the desired dimensions. You can tell if an insertee is resizable by
the kind of cursor that appears over the graphics panel: cross-hair for resizing, plus symbol for a simple drop - that is, addition at a point without resizing.</p>
